## Game progammed in C using SDL2 for Graphics - Based on Galaga

The intention for this game was really just for me to learn more C and low level languages. I had a whole lot of fun making this project come to life though and think it has come out quite well!

The gameplay actually gets harder as time goes on causing fun tension closing in on your last life.

I hope if you try it out, you enjoy it because I know I did making it!
